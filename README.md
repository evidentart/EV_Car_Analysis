# EV-Charging-Station-Analysis
Exploring global trends, availability, and efficiency of EV charging stations to optimize infrastructure development.

## Objective
- **Read dataset** of global EV charging stations
- **Preprocess data** (handle missing values, check shape, columns, and data integrity)
- **Explore dataset** statistically
- **Visualize the data** using various plots (barplot, scatterplot, histogram, box plot, etc.)
- **Analyze relationships** between station types, locations, and renewable energy usage

## Machine Learning
- **Train predictive models** to forecast charging station usage, including demand and energy consumption.
- **Feature Engineering** to enhance model performance, creating new features like charging utilization rates or geographical zones.
- **Train XGBoost model** with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- **Use Random Forest Regressor** as an additional model to predict station usage and energy consumption.
- **Evaluate models** using performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), RÂ² score, and cross-validation to ensure robustness.
- **Model Results:** The best model demonstrated effective prediction accuracy, but further refinement needed to enhance results.
